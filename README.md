# Simple Multi-Signature Wallet DApp

## Project Title
**SimpleMultiSigWallet** - A Decentralized Multi-Signature Wallet Smart Contract

## Project Description
The Simple Multi-Signature Wallet is a secure Ethereum smart contract that requires multiple signatures from designated owners to execute transactions. This wallet enhances security by distributing control among multiple parties, making it ideal for organizations, families, or groups who want to manage shared funds safely.

The contract implements a simple yet robust multi-signature mechanism where:
- Multiple owners are designated during contract deployment
- A minimum number of confirmations is required to execute any transaction
- All owners can submit transaction proposals
- Transactions are only executed when enough owners have confirmed them
- The wallet can receive Ether from any address
- Complete transaction history is maintained on-chain

## Project Vision
Our vision is to democratize secure cryptocurrency management by providing an accessible, transparent, and trustworthy multi-signature wallet solution. We aim to:

- **Enhance Security**: Eliminate single points of failure in cryptocurrency storage
- **Promote Collaboration**: Enable seamless shared fund management for teams and organizations
- **Increase Accessibility**: Provide a simple interface for complex multi-signature operations
- **Build Trust**: Create transparent, auditable financial operations through blockchain technology
- **Reduce Risk**: Minimize the chances of unauthorized access or malicious transactions

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- Hardhat or Truffle development environment
- MetaMask or similar Web3 wallet

### Deployment Parameters
When deploying the contract, you'll need:
1. **Owners Array**: List of Ethereum addresses that will be wallet owners
2. **Required Confirmations**: Number of signatures needed (must be ‚â§ number of owners)

### Example Deployment
```javascript
// Deploy with 3 owners requiring 2 confirmations
const owners = [
  "0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890",
  "0x2345678901234567890123456789012345678901", 
  "0x3456789012345678901234567890123456789012"
];
const requiredConfirmations = 2;
```

### Core Functions
1. **receive()**: Automatically accepts Ether deposits
2. **submitTransaction()**: Propose new transactions
3. **confirmTransaction()**: Approve pending transactions
4. **executeTransaction()**: Execute approved transactions
5. **getBalance()**: Check current wallet balance
